ESPNPlayerViewer
================

First make sure you've changed the database credentials in persistance-context.xml.

Secondly, you'll need to get a key for the ESPN API.  This'll need to go into

FootieViewer/src/main/java/com/footieview/app/importer/dao/PlayerImportDaoImpl.java

Until I get round to building a property file.
